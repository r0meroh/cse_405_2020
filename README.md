This is a class required remote repository to be used for the Spring 2020 CSE 405 Server Programming Course.
I am using WebStorm as my IDE of choice for the coding assignments of this class.

## Progress reports

### Git Progress report
This is the initial progress report for the week of **April 15th 2020.**
The objective was to set up a remote repository. 

### JavaScript and JSON
This is the progress report for the week of **April 24th 2020**

This report incorporates **Html,JavaScript,and JSON** fundamentals.
First off, I created a basic **Html text webpage** to display messages to the browser.

Next, I implemented a JavaScript code snipper to use with the <script> tag

 So far that gave us the output seen here in a **Chrome Browser**

 After this, I created a seperate Javascript file to 'import' into the html file

 Using the additional **Html** syntax, I created a list for instructions the user can follow

This, so far, has been easy to accomplish, but in lecture, we learned about using the browser's **Developer Tools** to compile
to a browser based console. For this I added the following to the JavaScript file to display array manipulation, concatenation, and function declerations/initializations and loops.

I also created a **Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm** from the pseudo code in the book I am currently reading "Fundamentals of Algorithmics"

Unfortunately, I could not figure out in time how to implement the same algorithm using JavaScript's promises. I wanted to use them in a recursive manner, I will keep trying to complete it.

Here is the end result the code displays on the web brower's console. I used console Warnings to facilitate the readability of the console between code snippets

The program also uses JavaScript's object oriented ability to implement objects and parse them into JSON styled output that can be written to an external file or sent to a server of choice
