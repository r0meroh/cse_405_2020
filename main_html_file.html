Below is basic html code to display contents onto a webpage.
The browser of choice is Google Chrome

<h2>Below is a javascript code snippet used within the html file</h2>

<!--
Below is a code block of javascript encapsulated within the html file using the 'script'
tag.

<script type="text/javascript">

    alert("hello world");

    //basic variable assignments and function declerations
    var x = 10;
    //this function was omitted from the webpage output, but left in the code to showcase
    //the various functionality learned for this assignment.
    function hugo(x) {
        if (x < 20) {
            x = x + 20;
            //here we write directly to the webpage using JavaScript with the window.document functions
            window.document.write("X was increased to : ");

            window.document.write(x);
        }

    }

    // from algorithmics, french multiplication binary algorithm
    // this algorithm is displayed within the webpage output.
